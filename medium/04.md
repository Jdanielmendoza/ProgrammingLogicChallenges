# 🚀 ICPC-Style Problem: The Largest Balanced Substring  

## 📝 Problem Statement  
A **balanced substring** is a substring that contains an equal number of characters `'A'` and `'B'`.  

Given a string **S** consisting only of characters `'A'` and `'B'`, find the length of the longest balanced substring.  

If no balanced substring exists, return `0`.  

## 🔹 Input  
- A string **S** (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10⁵), consisting only of the characters `'A'` and `'B'`.  

## 🔹 Output  
- An integer representing the length of the longest balanced substring.  

## 🧩 Examples  

### ✅ Example 1  
**Input:**
ABBABA
**Output:**
6
**Explanation:**  
The entire string `"ABBABA"` is balanced, so the answer is `6`.  

### ✅ Example 2  
**Input:**
AAABBBAA 
**Output:**
6

**Explanation:**  
The longest balanced substring is `"AABBBA"`, which has equal numbers of `'A'` and `'B'`, so the answer is `6`.  

### ✅ Example 3  
**Input:**
AAAA
**Output:**
0

**Explanation:**  
There is no balanced substring, so the output is `0`.  

## 🔥 Constraints  
- **1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10⁵**  
- **S** contains only `'A'` and `'B'`  

## 💡 Hints  
- Consider using prefix sums or a hash map to track indices efficiently.  
- A brute-force approach (checking all substrings) would be **O(n²)**, which is too slow. Can you solve it in **O(n)** time?
