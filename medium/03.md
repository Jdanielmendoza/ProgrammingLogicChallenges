# Exercise: Find the Longest Consecutive Sequence  

## Description  
Given an unsorted array of integers, write a function to find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.  

Your solution should run in **O(n) time complexity**.  

## Examples  

1. **Input:**  
   `[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`  
   **Output:**  
   `4`  
   **Explanation:** The longest consecutive sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, so the length is `4`.  

2. **Input:**  
   `[9, 1, 3, 10, 2, 20]`  
   **Output:**  
   `3`  
   **Explanation:** The longest consecutive sequence is `[1, 2, 3]`, so the length is `3`.  

3. **Input:**  
   `[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`  
   **Output:**  
   `6`  
   **Explanation:** The longest consecutive sequence is `[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, so the length is `6`.  

## Constraints  
- The input array may contain duplicate numbers.  
- The array length will be at most **10‚Å∂**.
